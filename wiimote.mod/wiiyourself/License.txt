 LICENSE:  My Wiimote library is free for any use, with
the following conditions:

1) Don't use it to harm anyone, directly or indirectly,
   including but not limited to military use (bruising
   egos is fine ;).
   
2) Any distribution in binary form (ie. linked with your
   program) includes this text in the included documentation
   (ReadMe file, help file, About box and/or splash screen):

   "contains WiiYourself! wiimote code by gl.tter
    http://gl.tter.org"

3) Any distribution in source code form keeps the original
   copyright notices intact unmodified (you can add to them),
   and includes this license text (either include this file in
   your distribution, or paste the text into your own licence).

4) Don't use the code to produce a competing library
   unless you rewrite it considerably (eg. to convert it
   to another language, but contact me first).
  
   Instead please contribute new features, fixes and ideas back.
