History:

0.99b:
    + added support for the Guitar Hero controller (thanks to Morgan Brown).
       It's just a Classic Controller with a different ID and is read the same,
       but can be differentiated via wiimote_state::extension_type::CLASSIC_GUITAR.

0.96b:
    + fix ClassicButtonNameFromBit[]
    + fix WIIYOURSELF_VERSION_MINOR2

0.95b:
    + Classic Controller button fixes (thanks Farshid).
    + sightly longer Sleep() in Reset() - hopefully fixes some reports of
       wiimote acceleration values not working.
    
0.94b:
    + deadzones weren't working.
    
0.93b:
    + ** compiled libs are now stored in /libs **
    + ** up to 4 dots are now available in every IR mode **
    + some 'state_change_flags' weren't quite generated correctly.
    - removed 'wiimote_state::polling' flags (redundant, flags are already
       returned via RefreshState()).
    + various internal improvements
    
0.92b:
    ** Polling changes **
      - now need to call RefreshState() once before each polling pass (see
         header comments & demo). this was done to synchronise the threaded
         state updates, so that data integrity is guaranteed.
    ** Callback changes **
      - combined 'wiimote_state_changed' and 'extension_state_changed' flags
         into 'state_change_flags
      - removed 'ExtensionChangedCallback' (only a single callback is used now)
      - added 'CallbackTriggerFlags' to minimize callback overhead
       (see header comments & demo)
    + added Reset() (see header comments)
    + button mask TRIGGER is now _B
    
    Demo: removed 'wiimote2' line (debug leftover)

0.82b:
    ** code/demo failed pre-XP (HID writes require XP+).  code now detects
        HID write support dynamically. **
    + tidied code & surpressed redundant warning (or just enable C++ exceptions).
    + Improved debug output (mainly DEEP_TRACE)
    + Connect() can now take (and defaults to) 'FIRST_AVAILABLE' as the wiimote
      index (see header comments).
    + 'wiimote_sample' is now auto-cleared on construction
    + Adjusted max 'theoretical' raw IR coord values (1023x767) to largest
       actually observed, to output full 0-1 float range.
    + **Inverted** IR X float coord to match traditional 'left = 0' convention
       (raw coords unaffected for now).
    + Added state recording ability to aid state/motion analysis.  See RecordState();
    - removed RequestBatteryUpdate() (battery level is now periodically refreshed)
    - disabled ...CALIBRATION_CHANGED flags (not useful)
    
    Demo  : should now work pre-XP.
    ReadMe: added Wiimote/PC installation notes (MS stack is especially tricky).

0.81b:
    + connection loss is now detected (via failed writes)
      + ConnectionWasLost() added
    + report modes renamed for clarity.
    + Connect(): added 'force_hidwrites' (for testing only).
    + Extension connections now seem to be reliable.
    + Battery is now periodically refreshed (also used for loss detection)
    + 'BatteryRaw' was set incorrectly
    + added 'wiimote::ClassicButtonNameFromBit[]'

    + Demo   : Classic Controller data shown.
    + Demo   : IR dot sizes now reported when possible (only if extension 
               data isn't requested as they're not available then).
            
    + License: 'no harm' clause added.
    + ReadMe : added build notes etc.

0.99b:
    First release.
